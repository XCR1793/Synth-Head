# Synth Head
To create an open source suit which can be worn by an individual and customised to their will. It also must be constructed in such a way that an average human could build it within a reasonable budget and time. The suit must be modular whilst remaining safe for the user to operate. The software must be easy to configure for any individual and has capability to modify without the need to always reflashing its firmware. The project was created according to this standard however, it has evolved over time to be more of a testing ground for sensors and other features of the like as I will continue this along with other projects I have due to compatibility.

## Overview
This project is always in the works and will be updated. Although regular updates are not possible due to me still being in uni, I will do what I can. This repo is basically a better version of the other repo and a true migration as the old one due to its structure. The reason for it being a new repo rather then just a fix is cause the title changed so the old link wouldn't have worked anyway. The current design is DX which stands for Design 10 as it is the 10th time the base shape has changed, the .3 at the end is an iterator for which version were on.

### Features
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Vacuum Formed Visor</strong> allows the user to see out of a clear shell rather then the previous mesh version which caused chromatic abberation, preventing the true colours of the display from emiting through the visor properly.
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Detachable Substructure</strong> which conformes to the visor ridge provides an easy to modify platform to which different displays, sensors and other modules.
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Builtin Head Restraint</strong> was designed to hold in an average head with relatively high pressure, although the pressure seems like it cause pain, the addition of a foam pad mitigates this and is actually comfortable to wear.
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Silent Slim Jaw Mount</strong> of around 6mm in total thickness is directly integrated to the shell.
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Snoot Sensors</strong> All of the sensors and modules are attached directly into the detachable substructure and can easily be replaced and upgraded as needed, many of which includes: Boop detection, snoot holding detection & IMUs.
* <strong style='color: #99ccff;'>Ventillation</strong> is key to an alive and well user, there are 2 fans located below the tongue which negatively ventillates the user.

### In the works
* The visor edge and mating surface will be changed due to it currently resulting in an uneven edge to edge connection.
* The builtin head restraint will also be upgraded, although the system works it is not the best designed as it is currently difficult to put the pins in place.
* Electronics & other cabling will be hidden in the final release as it is not compact due to the Rushed version built for speed and prototyping rather then stability.
* ARCOS migration is still under play, the entire library is basically being rewritten slowly so it runs faster with more features. The library is currently not accessable as it is privated but it will be released with the release of the synth head 10.3.
